Do I have any clue what I’m doing? Not at all, but I’m excited to begin this journey in learning new things. My goal is to use this as a way of giving back to the community all the things I’ve learned, as well as gain practice becoming a better writer. We’re going straight for the Feynman method: if you can teach it, you understand it.</p>\n<p>To be honest, I’ve done a lot of random things in my life. It’s a bit of a downside to always wanting new challenges and to meet new people. But I also feel like I was in a bit of a suspended state, unsure of what I really wanted to do for work. For me, a singular passion never came easy. I used to see that as a personality flaw, but I came to realize that I simply wanted too many things. See, if I’m not constantly learning, I’m going to get bored. If I’m not constantly engaging in analytical or logical thinking, I’m going to get bored.</p>\n<p>When I first started to code, I was confused, intrigued, but mostly downright fascinated! I mean this piece of hardware gives you near limitless potential to do almost anything. But where do you start, what stack do you learn, what languages, what area, SO MANY QUESTIONS. And that’s how it hit me that this wasn’t just an area with fantastic potential to create, but it was also an area of constant learning. I knew it was right for me.</p>\n<p>And that’s really the gist of it. It’s not long, it’s not overly romantic or goosebump inducing, but it’s how it came to be, and it’s how I ended up here.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/8ae4bbca09438e617ce76ce4c7c30461/bttf.gif\" alt=\"Fuuuuuture\"></p>"}
