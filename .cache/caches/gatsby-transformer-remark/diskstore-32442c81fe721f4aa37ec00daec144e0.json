What is that? It stands for JavaScript, APIs, and Markup. You can build a site by hand, use Jekyll, Hugo, Gatsby, etc. It allows you to build fast and secure sites (and apps) delivered by pre-rendering files and serving them directly, removing the requirement to run web servers. What makes them apart of the JAM stack is that they don’t depend on a web server. This can be fine for small, static sites, but if you want close coupling between server and client side, you’ll need to use something else.","position":{"start":{"line":6,"column":1,"offset":321},"end":{"line":6,"column":517,"offset":837}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":6,"column":1,"offset":321},"end":{"line":6,"column":517,"offset":837}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Enter MERN.
