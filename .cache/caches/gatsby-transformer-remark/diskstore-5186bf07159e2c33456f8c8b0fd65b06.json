My second post already. One of the more difficult things when I first started was simply figuring out where to even begin. There are so many languages and tech stacks that you can utilize to accomplish what you want. That flexibility is great in time, but can be overwhleming at first.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/b10c87d7e0963bb56c107e1838c629cd/ice_cube_wtf.gif\" alt=\"wtf\"></p>\n<p>The JAM stack. What is that? It stands for JavaScript, APIs, and Markup. You can build a site by hand, use Jekyll, Hugo, Gatsby, etc. It allows you to build fast and secure sites (and apps) delivered by pre-rendering files and serving them directly, removing the requirement to run web servers. What makes them apart of the JAM stack is that they don’t depend on a web server. This can be fine for small, static sites, but if you want close coupling between server and client side, you’ll need to use something else.</p>\n<p>Enter MERN. It’s a JavaScript stack that uses MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js, which together provide an end-to-end framework to build web apps. Mongo is schema-less and stored in JSON. Express allows you to write code to interact with your nodes, simplifying the process. React allows you to create rich, interactive envrionments on the client side. Node.js can help you scale and use JavaScript outside the browser.</p>\n<p><img src=\"\"></p>\n<p>What’s LAMP? An old way of doing things you should avoid. Yes, I expect to hear some complaints about that, but if you’re learning then why not focus on the newest technologies? So remember, friends don’t let friends use old tech. Just say no.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/d9ddc77ce5582d2b2789042777bb6318/no.gif\" alt=\"no\"></p>"}
