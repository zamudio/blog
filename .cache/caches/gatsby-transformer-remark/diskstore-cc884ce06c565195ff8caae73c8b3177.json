Scott Fitzgerald, but The Great Gatsby now belongs to the JavaScript framework. I’m a big fan of this framework and I’ve used it to create both this blog and my personal portfolio site. But what exactly is it?</p>\n<p><img src=\"\"></p>\n<p>Gatsby uses a powerful preconfigurator to build a website that uses only static files. It loads pages incredibly fast, it does server-side rendering, code splitting, data prefetching, image loading, asset optimization and more. All included out of the box. You code and develop, Gatsby transforms it.</p>\n<p><img src=\"\"></p>\n<p>Okay, but why use Gatsby over other frameworks? Well, the ecosystem is rich and has great docs, including a number of templates and start designs to get you started. The performance is blazing fast, in a way that will surprise you. Finally, it uses GraphQL for its data layer. Using that, you can collect your data from anywhere: JSON, CMS, APIs, whataver, and at build time Gatsby will create an internal GraphQL server and query all data from the same place, in the same way, for your react components.</p>\n<h3>The Downsides</h3>\n<p><img src=\"\"></p>\n<p>Yes, there are always downsides in life and this is no exception. While the framwork is great, it does require a knowledge of both React and GraphQL. But hey, if you haven’t learned those yet, it’s never too late to start.</p>"}
