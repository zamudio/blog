The files and their history are stored locally. But you might be wondering, “if everything is saved locally, what’s the big deal?”</p>\n<h3>GitHub (or GitLab, or Bitbucket, etc)</h3>\n<p>GitHub is an online host that runs on Git that allows you to store a copy of your files remotely. This magic is what allows collaboration, easy open-source contributions, and what makes Git such a necessary tool for a developer. The easiest way to understand how these online hosts work is to imagine a Google doc that is being worked on by multiple group members. Each person is working on their own machine, but connecting to a centralized version that takes in every person’s contribution.</p>\n<p><img src=\"\"></p>\n<h3>How it works, and some commands to become familiar with</h3>\n<p>To begin, you need to initialize a Git repository.
